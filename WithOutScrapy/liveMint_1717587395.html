Some holders of Byju's Alpha Inc’s term loan and Glas Trust Company have filed petitions in the US to initiate involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings against three US-based guarantors of this loan –- Epic! Creations Inc, Neuron Fuel Inc, and Tangible Play Inc – the lenders said in a statement on Wednesday. Glas Trust, a US-based non-banking loan agency, was appointed by over 100 lenders as an administrative agent for the $1.2-billion term loan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Since Byju’s began to default on its term loan obligations shortly after we provided Byju’s Alpha (the US subsidiary of Byju’s) with financing in 2021, we have made every effort possible to work productively and collaboratively to help Byju’s cure its multiple defaults,\" the lenders said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"However, it is clear that Byju’s management has no intention or ability to honour its obligations. Indeed, Byju’s founders, who also serve as the three directors of the overall enterprise — Byju Raveendran, Riju Ravindran and Divya Gokulnath — unlawfully diverted $533 million in loan proceeds, the whereabouts of which are still unknown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA person familiar with the matter said, \"No bankruptcy proceedings have been initiated against Epic. But in the existing Chapter 11 proceedings against Alpha, they have asked Epic to produce documents.\" A spokesperson for Byju's did not immediately respond to Mint's queries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn September, Mint reported that the edtech firm had put two of its businesses -- reading platform Epic and higher-education platform Great Learning – up for sale to pay its term loan B lenders. Byju's had acquired both companies during the starting funding rush of 2021 to build its $22-billion empire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn November of that year, the company raised $1.2 billion through a term loan B from overseas investors when interest rates were low. However, relations between the company and its lenders have soured since then, and interest rates have also surged. The matter came to a head in June 2023, when the company skipped an interest payment and took its lenders to court to prevent an acceleration of the repayment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“As a result of Byju’s failed leadership and mismanagement, significant harm has been done to its businesses and the value of its assets. Shareholders and lenders of the company have seen the value of their investments deteriorate, employees and vendors have not been paid in a timely manner, and customers have suffered,\" the lenders said in the statement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey added that they were taking action to preserve the value of these assets. \"We remain committed to their success and are ready to infuse the capital necessary to reorganise the businesses. Under the supervision of the court, the lenders hope that Epic, Neuron Fuel and Tangible Play will benefit from much-needed oversight while a plan is developed to maximise the value of these assets for the benefit of all stakeholders.”\u003c/p\u003e"},"image":null,"video":null,"liveBlog":null,"listicle":null,"listicleType":"","listicleArray":null,"listicleBulletType":null,"listicleHeadline":null,"indicesNew":null,"relatedStories":null,"collectionStories":null,"embed":null,"collectionPages":null,"elements":null,"listElement":null,"amazonAds":null,"flipkartAds":null,"cromaAds":null,"containAffiliateEmbed":false,"affiliateEmbedHeadline":true,"headline":"","summary":"","quickReadSummary":"","mobileHeadline":"","mobileAppNotificationHeadline":"","browserNotificationHeadline":"","facebookHeadline":"","subType":"","jsonSourceUrl":"","twitterHeadline":"","urlHeadline":"","leadMedia":null,"timeToRead":null,"linkStoryId":null,"introBody":"","webType":"","related":null,"showRelated":null,"newsletterHeadline":"","newsletterSummary":"","webStorySlide":null,"logoUrl":null,"logoPosition":null,"hasSlideImage":false,"hasSlideVideo":false,"hasLogoImage":false,"creditInfo":null,"altText":null,"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"keywords":null,"slideAnimation":"","sampleImagesIdList":[],"sampleImages":[],"personalisedSection":null,"personalisedSectionId":null,"paywallElement":false,"faqSectionHeading":null,"faqs":null,"tagline":null,"tabElements":null,"quiz":null,"poll":null,"bgParaColor":{"name":"","code":""},"quoteDesign":"Bold","contentHeading":null,"multipleLeadMediaIds":[],"multipleLeadMediaImages":[],"alsoReadStories":null,"alsoReadStoryIdList":null,"alsoReadStoriesUrl":null,"steps":null}],"amazonAds":null,"flipkartAds":null,"cromaAds":null,"containAffiliateEmbed":false,"affiliateEmbedHeadline":false,"headline":"Byju's term-loan lenders kick off bankruptcy proceedings against its US assets","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe lenders said they have initiated involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings against three guarantors of the loan – Epic!

On wheels, when they are shaped like vehicles; on giant humanoid feet when they are not. For decades, most real-world robots also fell neatly into these two fictional paradigms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, around 15 years ago, came the realisation that other means of locomotion were possible. “\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.economist.com%2Fscience-and-technology%2F2011%2F07%2F07%2Fzoobotics\u0026amp;sa=D\u0026amp;source=docs\u0026amp;ust=1711634945501502\u0026amp;usg=AOvVaw34K5XwxSbdaq1fhjnt0H4e\"\u003eZoomorphic”\u003c/a\u003e robots mined the animal kingdom for inspiration, piggybacking on evolution’s millennia of research and development. One mimicked an octopus’s malleable arm, allowing it to easily grasp objects and manoeuvre into tight, tricky spaces. Another replicated the ridge-covered toes of a gecko and, consequently, its ability to scale walls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnimal-like robots continue to be popular. In recent years both America’s and Britain’s armed forces have experimented with quadrupedal robot “dogs” for patrols and surveillance; in February a snake-shaped robot was sent into one of the damaged nuclear reactors of the Fukushima power plant in Japan to inspect the debris left inside. And yet, says Barbara Mazzolai, an Italian roboticist, the field of robotics has proved far less keen to investigate the other major category of living things—plants. She attributes the reluctance to a misconception about the usefulness of plant behaviour: that they are capable of neither motion nor perception. “It’s not true at all,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDr Mazzolai and her team at the Bioinspired Soft Robotics Laboratory at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Genoa recently unveiled a machine meant to uproot this dogma. Writing in Science Robotics, they described “FiloBot”, a robot based on climbing plants. Like the real thing, FiloBot (from the Italian word for “tendril”) is capable of growing, attaching to and twining around supports, and navigating through an environment in response to external stimuli.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo survive, a climbing plant must have the capacity to switch between several different modes of behaviour. In forest environments, it must first grow out of the soil and travel along the ground in search of a support to latch onto—a nearby tree, say. To do this the plant must have a structure capable of bearing its own weight. Once a support is located, though, the plant must switch strategy—anchoring itself around the object and then growing upwards towards the light. To outcompete other plants, it must move as quickly as possible, prioritising rapid growth over heft.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo help it choose the best angle at which to grow, a climbing plant uses information from light and gravity receptors distributed along each shoot. It can also modify the bulkiness of its tendrils by changing how their constituent cells divide and elongate: more padding in the middle will create a firmer tendril, while extra growth on one side will lead to curvature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMove into the light\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFiloBot mimics these behaviours using sensors in its head—at the tip of the main shoot—which is also equipped with a spool of plastic and a heating element. By melting and extruding the plastic in a circular pattern, it can 3D-print its own body at a rate of between two and seven millimetres per minute (bamboo, the world’s speediest plant, cannot beat 0.1). Depending on brightness and orientation, it alters the heat that the plastic is exposed to—lower temperatures result in a more brittle body that increases in size more quickly, while higher temperatures make denser and stronger clumps that grow more slowly. By varying the amount of plastic deposited around the circle, it can also grow in a rotating pattern to coil around a support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe researchers found that these simple functionalities were enough to let FiloBot move through a complex, unseen environment, cross gaps and find things to attach to. The lack of heavy on-board computing hardware, they say, means that it remains nimble and requires minimal oversight, while its slow pace means that it doesn’t disturb things around it. They reckon that this makes it suitable for potential applications including environmental monitoring in hard-to-reach or unknown locations (where piloting a robot along an exact course might be impossible), or monitoring disaster sites where existing infrastructure is unstable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, as the researchers tweak and test it further, FiloBot’s tendrils have not left the laboratory. Still, it has already been useful in deconstructing plant behaviour. For example, it was long hypothesised that climbing plants find their supports by harnessing an ability to grow towards shade, though the exact mechanism was unclear. FiloBot could replicate this behaviour by seeking out the far-red wavelengths characteristic of shaded areas, providing an insight into how plants might accomplish the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFiloBot is not the only plantlike robot the team is cultivating. Dr Mazzolai has been developing “plantoids”, based on roots, since 2012 (then the first plant-inspired robotics venture in the world). These can burrow through earth, and could be used to analyse chemicals or find water. And in 2021 the group at IIT, along with European partners, started developing “I-Seed”, a biodegradable mini-bot that can be moved about by wind and rain and change shape according to humidity. Based on the seeds of the South African geranium, it could be used to carry and distribute real seeds for reforestation, opening up and releasing its cargo once it hits suitable soil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDr Mazzolai hopes that such projects will inspire other roboticists to take their cues from botany. The plant kingdom is another world, she says, with a completely different approach to the animal one. “And so we can develop completely new technologies and artificial solutions, because it is so different.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e© 2024, The Economist Newspaper Limited.

It is almost 300 times as much as what America’s best-paid CEO for 2023 earned ($162 million). It is also more than twice the annual free cash flows Tesla has generated in its entire existence, including expectations for this year ($22.5 billion). And, crucially for shareholders, who would pay for it through the dilution of their holdings, it is about 8% of the company’s market value ($557 billion).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy would they vote for such an outcome?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne argument is that Musk did a fantastic job and deserves to be compensated for it. As the biggest beneficiary of Tesla’s meteoric stock-market rise in 2020 and 2021, though, he was—so fantastically that he became the world’s richest man for a while. The roughly 505 million shares he already owned at the end of 2017, before the stock-option plan now in question was on the table, increased in value by $171 billion by the time he started selling some in April 2022 to pay for Twitter, since rebranded as X.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA more reasonable point is that the 2018 plan was dependent on Musk hitting market-value milestones that seemed fanciful at the time; denying it after the fact because the crazy bet paid off reflects hindsight bias. This explains why some longtime Tesla shareholders such as Scottish fund manager Baillie Gifford, which voted for the deal back in 2018, have said they will support it again. Agreeing to something you don’t think will happen and then changing your position when it does isn’t a good look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut getting caught up in the convoluted back story also seems like a trap. Not every shareholder was around in 2018. Since Tesla, responding to a successful legal challenge against the original deal, has asked investors to vote on it again with the benefit of hindsight, it would be insane not to use that hindsight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, there is the question of keeping Musk motivated. The mercurial CEO tweeted in January that he felt “uncomfortable” growing Tesla “to be a leader in AI \u0026amp; robotics” with less than 25% of the voting rights and threatened to “build products” outside of Tesla. He recently raised $6 billion for his generative AI startup, xAI, at a $24 billion valuation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the threats ring somewhat hollow given that Musk still owns $72 billion worth of Tesla shares. That is a large proportion of his net wealth, even if his stake in SpaceX may now be comparable following the recent decline in Tesla’s stock. Also, Tesla has already invested massively in AI and generates huge amounts of visual data for AI training. Musk couldn’t easily jump ship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe coming vote is hardly the final word in the matter of the CEO’s pay. It is no more than a tactic Tesla is using to challenge the Delaware court ruling that in January voided the 2018 compensation plan. The legal games will continue whatever the outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTake another step back and the spectacle of Tesla’s board, led by Chairwoman Robyn Denholm, trying to whip up support for Musk’s pay only highlights the corporate-governance problem that led to the deal’s dismissal in court: the domination of Tesla’s board by the CEO it is supposed to oversee. Put another way, Musk runs Tesla like a family business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t always a bad thing: Family businesses have impressive stock-market records in developed markets, precisely because they have strong leaders with “skin in the game” like Musk. But corporate governance does exist for a reason, which is to protect minority shareholders from being exploited by powerful insiders. This seems like a case in point: Musk seemingly wants to take money from Tesla’s minorities to fund projects such as X and xAI.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Tesla’s board under Musk’s thumb, shareholders have nobody to look after their interests but themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWrite to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},"image":null,"video":null,"liveBlog":null,"listicle":null,"listicleType":"","listicleArray":null,"listicleBulletType":null,"listicleHeadline":null,"indicesNew":null,"relatedStories":null,"collectionStories":null,"embed":null,"collectionPages":null,"elements":null,"listElement":null,"amazonAds":null,"flipkartAds":null,"cromaAds":null,"containAffiliateEmbed":false,"affiliateEmbedHeadline":true,"headline":"","summary":"","quickReadSummary":"","mobileHeadline":"","mobileAppNotificationHeadline":"","browserNotificationHeadline":"","facebookHeadline":"","subType":"","jsonSourceUrl":"","twitterHeadline":"","urlHeadline":"","leadMedia":null,"timeToRead":null,"linkStoryId":null,"introBody":"","webType":"","related":null,"showRelated":null,"newsletterHeadline":"","newsletterSummary":"","webStorySlide":null,"logoUrl":null,"logoPosition":null,"hasSlideImage":false,"hasSlideVideo":false,"hasLogoImage":false,"creditInfo":null,"altText":null,"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"keywords":null,"slideAnimation":"","sampleImagesIdList":[],"sampleImages":[],"personalisedSection":null,"personalisedSectionId":null,"paywallElement":false,"faqSectionHeading":null,"faqs":null,"tagline":null,"tabElements":null,"quiz":null,"poll":null,"bgParaColor":{"name":"","code":""},"quoteDesign":"Bold","contentHeading":null,"multipleLeadMediaIds":[],"multipleLeadMediaImages":[],"alsoReadStories":null,"alsoReadStoryIdList":null,"alsoReadStoriesUrl":null,"steps":null}],"amazonAds":null,"flipkartAds":null,"cromaAds":null,"containAffiliateEmbed":false,"affiliateEmbedHeadline":false,"headline":"The case against Elon Musk’s $46 billion pay deal","summary":"Tesla’s board is asking shareholders to approve a substantial dilution of their stakes for no good reason.","quickReadSummary":"The upcoming vote on Elon Musk's $46 billion pay deal at Tesla's AGM is controversial.
